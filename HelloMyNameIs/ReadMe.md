# Hello My Name Is SAO
For their Supercon in 2024 a contest for simple add-ons was held by hackaday.
My first entry to this contest was a a simple name Tag design,
since programming badges can be overwhelming and the contest called for all sorts of cool stuff,
I saw this as my "pièce de résistance" project to warm up with KiCad again.

## errata
For the event I had ordered 3 boards each in green, red and blue. 
The blue version has the order number on the front.
All of them only have one of the LEDs correctly connected, for the other three you have to botch a bit.
But 1 LED seems plenty strong already anyways.

## files
There are two versions, but you're probably most interested in the LED version - that would be in the "blinkyparts style" folder.
