# Mr. Robot Badge

This was inspired by the big Mr. Robot badge. SAO thatâ€™s supposed to be an I2C soundcard. Piezo has a little amp. Order in afterdark mode.

Designed in Eagle 6.5 iirc

currently not working the way it's intended, the amplifier section is not working like the bodged Version 1 did.
