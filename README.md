# Simple-Add-ons-SAO
Find all of my ~~shitty~~ simple add-ons in this repository. Plus some badges that were never converted to SAO but they still blink and everything.

Current uploads:
 - **COVID-19 badge** blinks with the help of a 555 timer on the back
 - **Vendetta badge** "remember, remember the 5th of November" - or anything else with the help of the little EEPROM on the back of this badge
  - **Mr. Robot** with Attiny speaker
 - library stick to show off all your simple add-ons

More to come:

 - Do or Donut, LED sprinkle matrix
 - small penghicorn badge
 - Knight Rider badge
 - retro spacehuhn badge
 - sloth badge
 - flux capacitor
